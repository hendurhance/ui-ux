### Information Architecture and Interaction Design
> Information architecture (IA) is the practice of planning and structuring information in a way that makes it easy to find, use, and manage. Interaction design is the practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services. Interaction design focuses on creating meaningful and relevant experiences between users and their products.

#### Information Architecture
> An information architecture is a document that provides an operational map to how a product acts and functions work for users. It's akin to a blueprint for digital products, and it displays pages, content, interactions, and behaviors for the entire product.

##### Goals

#### Interaction Design
> Interaction Design (IxD) is the design of interactive products and services in which a designer's focus goes beyond the item in development to include the way users will interact with it.

### Design Thinking
> Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test. Involving five phases—Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test—it is most useful to tackle problems that are ill-defined or unknown. Although we have talked about some of these phases in the previous sections, we will now go into more detail on how it all fits together.

#### Design Thinking Process
> The design thinking process is a five-step process that helps you to solve problems and create innovative solutions. It is a human-centered approach to problem solving that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.
